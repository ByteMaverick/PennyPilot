# Team 7 Project Proposal

## Project Selection
The project option we have chosen is a **Personal Budgeting Application**.

We selected this project because it interests both of us and is highly applicable to our daily lives. Out of all three available options, this one stood out as the most practical and relevant. Since we both want to track our finances more efficiently, developing an application that facilitates this will be both exciting and beneficial.

## Skills to Develop
Through this project, we aim to develop and apply various **Python programming techniques** that we are learning in class. Specifically, we want to:
- Integrate multiple Python programming concepts (e.g., packages, lambdas, file handling, etc.) into a large-scale project.
- Enhance our skills in developing **Python GUIs**.
- Improve our proficiency in **version control with Git**, as we will store and manage our code using a GitHub repository.

## Project Title
**PennyPilot**

## Project Description
**PennyPilot** is a personal budgeting application designed to help users track and manage their finances with an intuitive and user-friendly GUI.

### Core Features:
- **User Profiles**: Users can create multiple profiles to track different financial accounts.
- **Data Import & Export**: Users can import and export financial data in **.CSV** format.
- **Expense & Income Categorization**: Users can define categories for expenses (e.g., Transportation, Food) and income sources (e.g., Salary, Rental Income).
- **Local Database Storage**: User credentials (username, password) and financial data (expenses, income, categories, timestamps) will be stored in an **SQLite database**.
- **Data Visualization**: The app will generate **charts and graphs** to help users analyze their finances.

## Project Stages & Timeline
We have a total of **2 months** to complete this project (deadline: **May 1st**). Below is our project timeline:

### **1. Planning & Research (Week 1)**
- Select a suitable development framework.
- Research and finalize tools required for implementation.
- Define core functionalities and features.
- Create **UML and ERD diagrams** to outline the system design.

### **2. UI Design (Week 2)**
- Develop high-fidelity UI mockups using **Figma** or **Adobe XD**.
- Ensure accessibility and user-friendly navigation with modern UI principles.

### **3. UI Development (Weeks 3-6) (Concurrent with Backend Development)**
- Develop and implement the designed UI using **Tkinter**.
- Ensure a smooth and seamless user experience.

### **4. Backend Development (Weeks 3-6) (Concurrent with UI Development)**
- Set up and integrate the **SQLite database**.
- Implement data visualization using **Matplotlib**.
- Develop logic for financial data tracking and integrate it with the UI.

### **5. Testing & Debugging (Week 7)**
- Perform extensive testing of all features.
- Conduct unit tests to identify and fix potential bugs.

### **6. Final Report & Submission (Week 8)**
- Compile final documentation and create a project presentation.
- Submit the final project and report.

## Technologies & Tools
To ensure efficient development and organization, we will use the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern** to structure our application.

- **Frontend (GUI)**: **Tkinter**
- **Data Visualization**: **Matplotlib**
- **Database**: **SQLite** (via `sqlite3` library)
- **Data Analysis**: **Pandas** (for financial data manipulation and insights)
- **Version Control**: **Git** (managed on **GitHub**)

## Additional Features (If Time Permits)
If we have additional time, we may incorporate the following features:
- **Cloud Storage**: Shift from local storage to cloud-based storage using **MongoDB**.
- **Spending Projection**: Implement a **Machine Learning model** to predict future monthly spending.
- **Customization**: Provide UI theme options (e.g., Light Mode, Dark Mode).
- **Currency Conversion**: Implement real-time currency exchange support for users dealing with multiple currencies.

## Conclusion
PennyPilot is an ambitious yet practical project that aligns with our interests and academic learning. By the end of this project, we aim to enhance our programming, UI/UX design, database management, and version control skills, making us more proficient in real-world software development.
